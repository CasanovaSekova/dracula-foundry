# Dracula Theme
My take on the open theme [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) and [Dracula UI](https://draculatheme.com/ui) for Foundry VTT. Heavily inspired/taken from theripper93 and mouse0270's [Argon Combat Hud](https://github.com/theripper93/enhancedcombathud/) as well. 

The module is for creating a dark mode variant for Foundry's default light theme. The goal is to recolour most of the light elements.

It is a work in progress but most menus in Foundry have been skinned/touched by the module so far. If you see something off, let me know and I'll see what I can do.

Substantial help by @typhonrt with advice, refactoring, and a whole list of things I would not be able to write down in a day

Inspired heavily by [Argon Combat Hud](https://github.com/theripper93/enhancedcombathud/) by theripper93 and mouse0270 with some help by Ripper
