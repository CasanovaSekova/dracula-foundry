# Dracula Theme
Heavily inspired/taken from theripper93 and mouse0270's [Argon Combat Hud](https://github.com/theripper93/enhancedcombathud/) plus the open theme [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) and Dracula UI.

I made this to fill in gaps between mods that leave menus untouched to give the UI visual consistency in my setup and sharing for anyone else who hates looking at light menus.

This is a work in progress but most menus in Foundry have been skinned/touched by the module so far. If you see something off, let me know and I'll see what I can do. I've been working on it for v9 so there may be strange issues in 8.9.

## Coverage
### Done
1. Convert to module
2. Windows
3. Input forms
4. Scrollbar
5. Chat cards
     - Core (as far as I'm aware)
     - MidiQOL
6. Combat Carousel
7. Monk's Token Bar
     - Roll requests (Chat cards and Window)

### To-do
- Fix grey text in filter/search bars
- DAE menu tables
- Monk's Token Bar (The Actual Token Bar)
- Better css file for Combat Carousel
- Potential for theme styling/changing colour values
- Keep working at it until I'm satisfied with the look

### Aesthetic Debates
- Too much gradient?
     - Too dull without more colour in early mockup
     - Difficult to balance colour and greys ðŸ˜”

### Won't do
- Changing the functions of the sidebar/UI (I am too weak to do this and there are much better people than me doing this already)

### Recommended Modules
- Argon Combat HUD (duh)
- Minimal UI
