# Dracula Theme
My take on the open theme [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) and [Dracula UI](https://draculatheme.com/ui) for Foundry VTT. I hate light UIs with a passion and wanted to make something I could enjoy looking at. I'm sharing this for anyone else who also hates light UIs.

It is relatively system agnostic because most of the reskinning is for core foundry. Keep in mind it will likely not play well with systems that use a lot of system specific theming. D&D 5e will have the most support/integration due to it being my main system.

If you see something off, let me know and I'll see what I can do.
