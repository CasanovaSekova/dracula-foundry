# Dracula Theme
Heavily inspired/taken from theripper93 and mouse0270's [Argon Combat Hud](https://github.com/theripper93/enhancedcombathud/) and the open theme [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com). Currently just css for the [Custom CSS module](https://github.com/cswendrowski/FoundryVTT-Custom-CSS).

I made this to fill in gaps between mods that leave menus untouched to give the UI visual consistency in my setup and sharing for anyone else who hates looking at light menus.

## Coverage
### Done
1. Windows
2. Input forms
3. Scrollbar
4. Chat cards
     - Core (as far as I'm aware)
     - MidiQOL
6. Combat Carousel
7. Monk's Token Bar
     - Roll requests (Chat cards and Window)

### To-do
- Double check for consistency
- Fix grey text in filter/search bars
- Monk's Token Bar (The Actual Token Bar)
- Better css file for Combat Carousel
- Convert to proper module?

### Extras
- Argon Combat HUD Colour Scheme

### Won't do
- Changing the functions of the sidebar/UI (I am too weak to do this and there are much better people than me doing this already)
