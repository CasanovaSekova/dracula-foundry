# Dracula Theme
My take on the open theme [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) and [Dracula UI](https://draculatheme.com/ui) for Foundry VTT. Heavily inspired/taken by theripper93 and mouse0270's [Argon Combat Hud](https://github.com/theripper93/enhancedcombathud/). 

Currently incomplete, but most menus in Foundry have been skinned/touched by the module so far. This is intended to be mostly system agnostic as the focus is primarily on reskinning core foundry. Will likely not play well with systems that use a lot of custom theming beyond core.

If you see something off, let me know and I'll see what I can do.

Substantial help by @typhonrt with advice, refactoring, and a whole list of things I would not be able to write down in a day

Inspired heavily by [Argon Combat Hud](https://github.com/theripper93/enhancedcombathud/) by theripper93 and mouse0270 with some help by Ripper
