# Dracula Theme
My take on the open theme [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) and [Dracula UI](https://draculatheme.com/ui) for Foundry VTT. Heavily inspired by theripper93's [Argon Combat Hud](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/enhancedcombathud) as well.

It is relatively system agnostic because most of the reskinning is for core foundry. Keep in mind it will likely not play well with systems that use a lot of system specific theming. D&D 5e will have the most support/integration due to it being my main system.

The module will likely remain relatively static aside from a few tweaks here and there or additional module compatibility. I made this theme mostly out of a dislike for light UIs and a love for the Dracula colour scheme and I got what I wanted out of it, but I also know there were a few people who wanted to use it and likely more who also hate light UIs.

I'm also publishing this as a foundation / skeleton for anyone else who wants to dip into modifying Foundry into a darker UI or experimenting with the Foundry UI. TyphonJS, who helped me with a significant portion of this, is making his own theme with Dracula as a foundation with dynamic colour theming, palettes, and other colour-based additions.

If you see something off, let me know and I'll see what I can do.
